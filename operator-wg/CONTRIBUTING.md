## How do I get involved

- Our working group [meetings](https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery/tree/master/operator-wg#meetings).

## How to contribute

Please take a look at the [Project board](https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery/projects/1) and:

1. Pick an issue/white paper section that you would like to contribute.
2. Reach out to us on slack and we will assign the issue to you/update progress.
3. Fork/Make a Pull Request.
4. If itâ€™s a major change, that will go through a one week cycle for review.
5. Once there are at least two approvals by the WG chairs and the time is up, your change will be merged to https://github.com/cncf/sig-app-delivery/tree/master/operator-wg/whitepaper

If you have any suggestions or questions, please let us know here or attend any of our bi-weekly meetings. We have the objective to find assignees for the remaining issues by the next WG meeting. Your collaboration will be very welcome. Thank you!
